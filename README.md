# MNIST Neural Network Experiment

This project is an experimental implementation of a neural network for MNIST digit classification. It's currently a work in progress and serves as a template or starting point for further development.

## Project Description

This neural network is designed to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The current implementation includes:

- Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset
- One-hot encoding of labels
- Normalization of pixel values
- Reshaping of images to 1D arrays
- A basic neural network implementation in the `mnistnn` module

This is a toy implementation and is not yet optimized for full MNIST classification.

## Installation

1. Install pyenv for managing virtual environments:

```pip install pyenv```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```pyenv virtualenv mnistnn```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
```pyenv activate mnistnn```

4. Install the required packages:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Future Work
This project needs further development and debugging to be a fully functional neural network for MNIST classification.
